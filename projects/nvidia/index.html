    <h1>NVIDIA Growth Analysis</h1>
    <p>
      NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is a leader in graphics processing units and
      system‑on‑a‑chip technology. Its GPUs power gaming, professional
      visualisation, autonomous vehicles and increasingly the data centres
      underpinning generative AI. In recent years NVIDIA has become a
      critical enabler of the artificial intelligence boom.

    <h2>Stock Price and Future Projections</h2>
    <p>
      NVIDIA’s meteoric rise in market value reflects both explosive revenue
      growth and investor expectations that AI will dominate the coming
      decade. The chart below illustrates an approximate trajectory of
      NVIDIA’s stock price alongside projected revenue through 2027.

    <p>
      <strong>Interpretation:</strong> NVIDIA’s revenue jumped from $26.9 B in
      2023 to $60.9 B in 2024 and is estimated at $130.5 B in 2025—an
      increase of over 114% year‑on‑year【403356823960948†L32-L39】. This explosive
      growth is tied to soaring demand for AI accelerators. If the current
      trajectory continues, revenue could surpass $200 B by 2027. The stock
      price, represented here illustratively, mirrors this optimism but is
      prone to volatility as investors weigh competition and supply‑chain
      risks. Overall, NVIDIA sits at the centre of a rapidly expanding AI
      ecosystem and remains a bellwether for the broader technology sector.
